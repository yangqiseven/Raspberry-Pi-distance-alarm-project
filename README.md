# Real-Time-Project-Team17
## Introduction
We are the Team 17 in the Real-Time Embedded Systems Programming course at the University of Glasgow, In this assignment, we developed and designed a software and a circuit device base on a Raspberry Pi model B+ system.
This software is designed for measure distance, then display in the screen and could notice by LED to alarm that the distance is already reaches the preset value.
This device is connected to the raspberry pi and the measured distance will be displayed on the computer screen

## Hardware Device
We used the HC-SR04 device in this project and it is relatively simple to manufacture because there are already have a A/D converter in the HC-SR04 device.And there is more information about the hardware design in the project wiki.


## Code
The all code about this project are already shows in the 'Code' repository.
